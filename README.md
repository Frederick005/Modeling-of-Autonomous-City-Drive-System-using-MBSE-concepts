# Modeling-of-Autonomous-City-Drive-System-using-MBSE-concepts
## Introduction
This project showcases the implementation of the Scenario Modeling Language for Kotlin (SMLK), a framework designed for modeling and programming the behavior of reactive software components using loosely coupled threads of behavior, called scenarios. The project demonstrates the application of SMLK in developing a scenario-based program, highlighting its features and capabilities.

## Project Overview
The project consists of several key components:

**SMLK Framework**: The core framework provides the foundation for creating scenario-based programs. It includes features such as event handling, scenario synchronization, and execution.
**Scenario Program**: A sample scenario program is included to demonstrate how to utilize the SMLK framework. The program models a reactive system with multiple scenarios, showcasing the framework's capabilities.
**Testing Framework**: A testing framework is provided to facilitate the verification of scenario programs. It allows users to write and execute tests for their scenario-based systems.

## Key Features
**Scenario Modeling**: SMLK enables the creation of scenario models, which describe the behavior of reactive systems.
**Event-Driven Programming**: The framework supports event-driven programming, allowing scenarios to react to events and interact with each other.
**Loose Coupling**: Scenarios are designed to be loosely coupled, promoting modularity and flexibility in system development.
**Scenario Synchronization**: SMLK provides mechanisms for synchronizing scenarios, ensuring consistent system behavior.

## Technical Details
**Programming Language**: The project is implemented in Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android and backend development.
**Dependencies**: The project relies on several Kotlin libraries, including coroutine support and logging frameworks.
